        <h1>The Song of the Flume</h1>
        <p>by Anna M.Fitch</p>

        <p> Awake, awake! for my track is red,	
            With the glow of the coming day;	
          And with tinkling tread, from my dusty bed,	
            I haste o’er the hills away,	
          Up from the valley, up from the plain,	        
            Up from the river’s side;	
          For I come with a gush, and a torrent’s rush,	
            And there’s wealth in my swelling tide.</p>

        <p> I am fed by the melting rills that start	
            Where the sparkling snow-peaks gleam,	       
          My voice is free, and with fiercest glee	
            I leap in the sun’s broad beam;	
          Tho’ torn from the channels deep and old,	
            I have worn through the craggy hill,	
          Yet I flow in pride, as my waters glide,	      
            And there’s mirth in my music still</p>
