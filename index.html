            <h1>The Song of the Flume</h1>
            <p>by Anna M.Fitch</p>

            <p> Awake, awake! for my track is red,<br>
                With the glow of the coming day;<br>
            And with tinkling tread, from my dusty bed,<br>	
                I haste o’er the hills away,<br>	
            Up from the valley, up from the plain,<br>	        
                Up from the river’s side;<br>	
            For I come with a gush, and a torrent’s rush,<br>	
                And there’s wealth in my swelling tide.</p>

            <p> I am fed by the melting rills that start<br>	
                Where the sparkling snow-peaks gleam,<br>	       
            My voice is free, and with fiercest glee<br>	
                I leap in the sun’s broad beam;<br>	
            Tho’ torn from the channels deep and old,<br>	
                I have worn through the craggy hill,<br>	
            Yet I flow in pride, as my waters glide,<br>	      
                And there’s mirth in my music still</p>
